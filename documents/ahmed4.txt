?By now, you may have heard about Ahmed Mohamed, a 9th grade student who was arrested in Texas for bringing a homemade clock to school. The clock wasn't a class assignment; Ahmed brought it to school to show off his impressive accomplishment. But upon seeing his creation, his teacher notified the administration, who called the local police. Ahmed was taken to a juvenile detention center in handcuffs and suspended from school for 3 days (thankfully, he won't be formally charged).

Despite the absurdity of the situation, and even after all the attention Ahmed's story has gotten today, Irving MacArthur High? School principal Daniel Cummings? still has no regrets. In a letter, he called the clock "a suspicious-looking item" and wrote, "Please rest assured that we will always take necessary steps to keep our school as safe as possible."?

There has been a rightful outcry against the school, and understandably, much of it focuses on whether this kid would have been arrested if he were a white student who likes to build gadgets in his free time—not a brown-skinned student named Ahmed Mohamed. It's an important question, because America needs more Ahmeds.
